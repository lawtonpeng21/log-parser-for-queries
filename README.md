# log-parser-for-queries

To use this program:
Replace log_folder_path with the actual path to the folder containing your log files.
The program will create output files with parsed data in the specified output_folder.
Customize the keyword, timestamp_pattern, and date_pattern to match the patterns in your log files.
Run the script, and it will process the log files, extract information, including usernames after the '#' symbol, and save the parsed data to CSV files in the output folder.
